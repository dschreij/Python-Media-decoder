## Dependencies

This module depends on the following libraries:

- MoviePy (<http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/>)
- pyaudio (<https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>)
- numpy (<http://www.numpy.org/>)

That should get you started if you plan to implement your own rendering functions to display the video frames. When you also want to be able to view the example provided by `play.py` you furthermore need

- pygame (<http://www.pygame.org/>)
- pyOpenGL (<http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>)
